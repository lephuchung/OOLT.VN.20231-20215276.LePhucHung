1)
If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- Yes, use the constructor below: 
	public DigitalVideoDisc(String category) {
		super();
		this.category = category;
	}

2)
Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
- Java is a "pass by value" programming language. 
- In Java, when you pass an argument to a method, you are actually passing a copy of the value of that argument. 
- This means that the method cannot modify the original variable that was passed as an argument.

3)
Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer
in this case?
- I prefer to the method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows an array parameter. I think it is more comfortable.
- However, in some case, the method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd will be more useful.

4)
After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
objects still remain?
- Because the method cannot modify the original variable that was passed as an argument.

5)
After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?
- Because changeTitle method first stores the old title of dvd.
- Then, it sets the title of dvd to the value of the title parameter, creates a new DigitalVideoDisc object with the old title.
- However, this newly created object is local to the method and does not affect the jungleDVD object outside the method.
