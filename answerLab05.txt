The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are called. What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch?
->If we overlook updating the Aims class to handle exceptions that may arise when the play() method is triggered, it could result in unmanaged exceptions. When an exception occurs during program execution and isn't properly caught and handled by an appropriate catch block, the exception will propagate upwards through the call stack.
Failing to capture the exception within the play() method or any of its calling methods might lead to an abrupt termination of the program. In such scenarios, an error message containing information about the unhandled exception will be shown in the console. This behavior is generally undesirable as it makes the program unreliable and has the potential to leave the system in an inconsistent state.
